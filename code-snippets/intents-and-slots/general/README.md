# General Intents and Slots

These intents and slots are ones which don't fit into a more specific category, or apply across multiple categories.

- [Characters Slot Type](./characters-slot) - This slot type is useful when a customer needs to specify alphanumeric characters.
- [Letters Slot Type](./letters-slot) - This slot type is useful when a customer needs to specify alphabetic  characters (aka letters).
- [Ordinal Slot Type](./ordinal-slot) - This slot type is useful when a customer needs to specify an ordered number (e.g. first, second, third) and there's no built-in slot type for it.
- [Directional Slot Type](./directions-slot) - This slot type is useful when a customer needs to specify a direction (e.g forward, back, left, right). Depending on the use case, it could be coupled with an action verb (e.g. move, look, aim) and/or a distance (e.g. four steps).
