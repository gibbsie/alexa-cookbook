# Characters Slot Type

Sometimes a customer needs to say letters, numbers or other characters to input a code (e.g. tracking number). This slot type helps when those values are individual characters instead of words.

> **WARNING** This slot is the combination of various phonetic alphabets, so there could be words that overlap with other slot values or sample utterances, including built-in's. (E.g. "william" is likely to be part of the AMAZON.US_FIRST_NAME built-in slot.) Be sure to review and remove any conflicting values.

> **NOTE** If your acceptable set of values doesn't include characters included in this slot type definition, it is recommended to remove them to reduce complexity.

We strongly recommend that you use the slot type name of **COOKBOOK_CharactersSlotType** so that you know that you based the slot type on content from the Alexa Cookbook and can return here to refresh/update your slot type with any newly added utterances.

## List of Utterances

> Note: the slot type values are comma separated in this order: value, id, synonym1, synonym2, ...
