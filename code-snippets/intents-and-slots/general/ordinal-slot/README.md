# Ordinal Slot Type

AMAZON.Ordinal is available only in selected locales, so this slot type will simulate that built-in slot type.  The included slot values only covers the 1-31 to enable month/calendar support, but can be extended if necessary.

We strongly recommend that you use the slot type name of **COOKBOOK_OrdinalSlotType** so that you know that you based the slot type on content from the Alexa Cookbook and can return here to refresh/update your slot type with any newly added utterances.

## List of Utterances
Use these values if your tool uses a simple list as the input mechanism (e.g. developer consoleâ€™s [Bulk Edit](https://developer.amazon.com/docs/custom-skills/create-intents-utterances-and-slots.html#edit-or-upload-sample-utterances-in-bulk)).

> Note: the slot type values are comma separated in this order: value, id, synonym1, synonym2, ...
